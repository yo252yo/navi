Zizek the Fennec\nis quite a wreck...
He lives in a\ngiant junkyard\nwhere finding food is rather hard.
Fennecs often\nfight and scrap\nfor rotten junk,\ntheir only snack.
From trash to trash they always roam\nhoping to find\na better home.
One day they meet Ideology\na magic bin\nthat speaks gaily.
Each time they eat\nsome smelly junk,\nthe trashcan compliments their spunk.
Distracted by this\ngreat surprise,\nthey stop all rebellions and cries.
Though they do not eat much better\nthey all believe\nthey're happier.
Nothing is too hard\nto swallow\nwhen presented with enough glow.
And thus, content to eat plastic and foam,\nthey gave up searching for a better home.
