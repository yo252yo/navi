Zupanzik the Big Tick\n has a life quite tragic.
The poor tick is\nalways hungry,\nnothing seems to\nfill her tummy.
Even when she's\neaten enough\nshe always wants to\neat more stuff.
When she runs around in the grass,\nshe drinks from a mouse without a glass.
"I know I must stop eating now,\nI’ve eaten way too much, somehow!"
But she continued anyhow.\n"I’ll just be more careful, I know!"
When she goes deep into the wood,\nshe drinks a boar and find it good.
"I know I must stop eating now,\nI’ve eaten way too much, somehow!"\nBut she continued anyhow.
When she goes on the frozen peaks,\nshe drinks a goat that's feeling weak.
"I know I must stop eating now,\nI’ve eaten way too much, somehow!"\nBut she continued anyhow.
When she arrives in\nthe city,\nshe drinks a fat rat with pity.
"I know I must stop eating now,\nI’ve eaten way too much, somehow!"
And she exploded.
