Lacan the Elephant\nstrolls along so elegant.
In a corner of the wood\nhe spots a tree\nthat’s looking good.
"It is such\na beautiful tree,\nI want to show everybody!" 
Lacan makes\na tiny drawing,\nbut he find it\nrather boring.
The colors he drew on the page\ndon’t shine like those on nature’s stage!
Lacan feels quite upset,\nhe’ll have to start anew, I bet!
He tries\nagain and again,\nbut his efforts are\nall in vain.
Lacan is sad,\nhe weeps and cries:\n"My drawings\ndon't reflect what I see\nwith my eyes!"
But then he looks\nall around,\nand what joy\nhe has found!
Though he didn't succeed in the end,\nhe's made lovely drawings for every friend!
