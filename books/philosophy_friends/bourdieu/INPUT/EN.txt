Bourdieu the Eel\ndoes not lack zeal.
He feels that the\neels' little town\nis too boring.\nWhat a yawn!
He wants to live in Fish City\nwhere the homes are\nbig and pretty.
He works very hard\nevery day\nand earns lots of money that way.
After he's saved up enough pay\nit's time for him to move away.
He really loves\nhis new mansion,\nhe fills it with decoration.
But his neighbors all sneer and frown,\nit's not the fashion of the town!
He tries to make\nnew friends,\nbut they mock how\nhe feels.\nHis taste and opinions are still those of\nan eel.
Bourdieu cries,\nhurt by this turn.\nHe has so much more left to learn.
He thought his efforts had earned his wish,\nbut the work is never-ending\nfor an eel\nto become a fish.
