Bourdieu the Eel
PIERRE BOURDIEU is a French sociologist known for the idea of CULTURAL CAPITAL.\nHe shows that it’s not only money that separates rich and poor people.\nThese inequalities are made stronger by many hidden things:\nyour tastes, your manners, the way you speak, the books you’ve read, or even the people you know...\nThey form an invisible “capital” that causes many kinds of DISCRIMINATION.
