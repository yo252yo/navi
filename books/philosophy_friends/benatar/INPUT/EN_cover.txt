Benatar the Jaguar
DAVID BENATAR is a South African philosopher who studies the difference between pleasure and pain.\nThe absence of pain is something good,\nbut the absence of pleasure is not bad, it is neutral:\nthis is what he calls ASYMMETRY.\nHe concludes that it is better to avoid experiences that can be negative, even if they can also be positive.
