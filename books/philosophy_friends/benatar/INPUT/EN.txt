Benatar the Jaguar\nhates the fog\nfrom afar.
He wonders\nwhat could hide\nin the thick mist outside.
There could be\na treasure,\nriches beyond measure.
Or quite a deadly scare,\nlike a snake\nhiding there.
He hesitates inside,\ntrying hard to decide.
"If I leave and\ngo far away,\nunknown dangers could come my way."
"No treasure for me\nif I stay,\nit's too bad,\nbut that’s okay!"
"Because I'll avoid trouble too,\nmy peace is priceless,\nit is true."
And so it always goes, you see,\nBenatar stays in his cave safely!
