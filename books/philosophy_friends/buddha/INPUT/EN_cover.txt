Buddha the Llama
BUDDHISM is a philosophy\ndeveloped by SIDDHARTHA GAUTAMA,\nwho gave up being a prince\nwhen he saw the pain of his people.\nHis thinking is based on the FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS:\n- Yes, suffering exists.\n- It has a clear cause.\n- But it can also end.\n- Therefore there is a way to reach that end.
