Buddha the Llama\nis the wise prince\nof the Himalaya.
Among flowery\nmountain peaks,\nhe finds a sad swan that weeps.
"I broke my wing,\nI'm in great pain!\nI'm sure I'll never\nfly again."
Buddha the Llama\nshares his woe:\n"I do understand\nyour sorrow..."
"But the root of\nyour suffering\nis in your mind,\nnot in your wing."
"One day, it's sure,\nyour tears will cease,\nfocus on how to reach that peace."
Looking at things\nin a new way\nthe swan finds\na new hope today.
He abandons\nthe endless sky,\nand finds a better\nplace nearby.
Never before did\nthis lake see\na swimmer so\nfull of beauty.
