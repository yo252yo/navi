Baudrillard the Mallard\nfeels gloomy and dullard.
He lives in a pond\nlarge and wide\nwith many ducks on every side.
Surrounded by\nmany others,\nhe feels like he\ndoes not matter.
To lift his mood and his bother\nhe visits his friend\nthe sculptor.
"I will help you\nnot feeling blue,\nI’ll make a big\nstatue of you!"
The artwork could not be clearer,\nit looks more like him than his mirror!
There's so much beautiful detail,\nit makes Baudrillard smile without fail!
With this,\nwherever he may go,\nhe is the center of\nthe show.
But compared to his perfect twin,\nhe appears ugly,\npale and thin.
Everyone, even\nfriends and kin,\nprefers the statue over him.
He is left behind\nin disgrace,\nhis copy has taken\nhis place!
But he holds no grudge, it is true!\nHe prefers fake Baudrillard too!
